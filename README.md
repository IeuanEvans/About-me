Whilst studying last year at Bristol I am discovered podcasts Towards Data Science and Freakonomic Radio on Spotify. the guests I most enjoyed listening to spoke enthusiastically about applying scientific principles and applying them to business problems. This was refreshing because all I knew at the time was academia and ultimately pushed me to start to explore new career paths. 

My masterâ€™s degree was primarily designed to prepare us for a research positions. I felt that I was going to take an alternative carrer path I'd need to upgrade my skills, so I bought a subscription to a data science course by Dataquest. I found Dataquest to be a brilliant resource for learning the fundamentals on python but not for much else. One piece of advice I kept encountering was to start a project, so I mapped out my first data science project. I thought it would be interesting do my project on professional road cycling. I was already a fan of the sport so I knew a good website I could mine data from. Gradually incorporating new tools into my project has been the most effective way of learning for me.

My at Bristol University was valuable, however my desire to engage more deeply with quantitative subjects was not being satisfied. Struggling with dyslexic meant I had to allocate more time to writing essays and reading papers than wanted.
