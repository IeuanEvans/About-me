When studying on my Epidemiology Master's degree at the University of Bristol, I discovered podcasts such as, "Towards Data Science" and "Freakonomic Radio" on Spotify. The guests I most enjoyed listening to spoke enthusiastically about applying scientific principles to business problems. This was refreshing because all I knew at the time was academia as my masterâ€™s degree was primarily designed to prepare students for research positions. This motivated me to start begin exploring new career paths. 

I felt that if I was going to take an alternative carrer path I'd need to upgrade my skills, so I bought a subscription to a data science course by Dataquest. I found Dataquest to be a brilliant resource for learning the fundamentals on python but not for much else. One piece of advice I kept encountering was to start a project, so I mapped out my first data science project. I thought it would be interesting do my project on professional road cycling. I was already a fan of the sport so I knew a good website I could mine data from. Gradually incorporating new tools into my project has been the most effective way of learning for me.

My time at Bristol University was valuable, however my desire to engage deeply with quantitative subjects was not being fully satisfied. Struggling with dyslexia meant I had to allocate more time to writing essays and reading papers than I wanted.
